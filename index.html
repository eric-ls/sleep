        <h2>Sleep in America</h2>
        <p>The average amount of sleep Americans get every night has been on the decrease, and about 1 in 3 Americans don't get the recommended amount of sleep each night. Here's how you compare with the general population.</p>

        <h2>Immune System</h2>
        <p>Sleep deprivation also has a toll on your immune system. In a study, participants were given influenza vaccinations and their antibody response was measured over the course of a couple of weeks. Those who slept 8 hours showed much higher antibody response and retention.</p>

        <h2>Weight Gain</h2>
        <p>Compared to those who receive 8 hours of sleep, sleep-deprived individuals have a greater urge to eat, and their hunger sensation is amplified. Sleep-deprived individuals also have a larger appetite for carbohydrate-heavy foods.</p>

        <h2>General Attentiveness</h2>
        <p>Sleep deprived individuals also are less attentive. A test called the psychomotor vigilance test measures how "attentive" people are. Here's how you compare with someone who receives <strong>no sleep</strong>. Take note that the effects of sleep deprivation will stack up, so a person who sleeps 6 hours every night will perform <strong>just as worse</strong> as someone who pulls an all-nighter after 10 nights!</p>

        <h2>Memory</h2>
        <p>Students take note! Your memory also suffers if you don't sleep. In a recent study, individuals were asked to memorize syllables from a list. Those who slept after the initial task were able to recall much more than those who remained awake.</p>

          <div class="tip">
            <h3>Stick to a schedule</h3>
            <p>Go to bed at the same time every day, since it will strenghten your body's circadian rhythm. That will make falling and staying asleep easier.</p>
          </div>
          <div class="tip">
            <h3>Avoid naps</h3>
            <p>Naps during the day, especially in the afternoon, can also affect and reset your circadian rhythm. Try to limit naps to 10-30 minutes.</p>
          </div>
          <div class="tip">
            <h3>Be careful of what you eat</h3>
            <p>Try not to eat too much before bed, and watch the caffeine! Caffeine can take hours to wear off, so avoid it in the evening.</p>
